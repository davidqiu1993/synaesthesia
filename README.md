# Emergence of Synaesthesia in Neuronal Network Models

Synaesthesia is an unusual perceptual experience in which an inducer stimulus
triggers a percept in a different domain in addition to its own. This project
implements the model neuronal network model proposed by Shriki et al., 2016.

## Training Process

Below shows the learning curve of `1000` iterations of training with learning
rate `0.00035`, where the network is trained with `1000` random samples drawn
from Gaussian distributions at each dimension of different modality.
